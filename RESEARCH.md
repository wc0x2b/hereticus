# Research

Published work that can make `hereticus` match functions better and find the
important changes faster. Each entry gives the source, the idea, and where it
applies in `hereticus`. When code applies an idea, the doc comment of that
function names the source from this file.

Survey date: 2026-10-04. The entries are in order of value for the effort.

## 1. Match functions by their matched neighbors

Source: *Enhancing Binary Code Similarity Analysis for Software Updates: A
Contextual Diffing Framework*, ASIA CCS 2025.
<https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3708821.3736207>

Idea: match functions recursively through the call graph of each version.
After a sure pair, the callers and callees of that pair become candidates of
each other. This makes Asm2Vec and SAFE up to 38.66% more accurate across
versions.

Applies to: twins that no instruction separates (see `TODO.md`). Two
byte-identical functions get different callers, and the callers often pair
first. `Cascade::pair_by_callers` in `matching.rs` already does a part of
this.

## 2. Diff as network alignment

Source: Mengin and Rossi, *Binary Diffing as a Network Alignment Problem via
Belief Propagation*, ASE 2021 (QBinDiff).
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15337>. Faster solver:
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15336>.

Idea: score a full mapping on two terms together: the similarity of each pair
and the number of call edges that the mapping keeps. Solve it with max-product
belief propagation. Greedy matchers, as BinDiff and Diaphora, solve easy
cases well but fail when the two programs differ more.

Applies to: the last scoring stage of the cascade, where pairs are chosen
greedily by score.

## 3. Seed, chain, extend

Source: Li, *Minimap2: pairwise alignment for nucleotide sequences*,
Bioinformatics 2018. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01492>

Idea: from genomics. Find short exact matches that are unique on both sides
(anchors). Keep the longest chain of anchors that is in order on both sides.
Align only the gaps between the anchors. Patience diff uses the same idea.

Applies to: `instruction_diff` and `longest_common_subsequence` in
`matching.rs`. Fewer bad alignments in long functions, and less time.

## 4. Constants as anchors for the fix

Source: Dong et al., *Fine-Grained 1-Day Vulnerability Detection in Binaries
via Patch Code Localization*, 2025 (PLocator).
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17413>

Idea: scalar constants stay stable across compilers and optimization levels.
Use them as anchors in the control-flow graph to find the code of the patch.
88.2% true positive rate, 12.9% false positive rate, 0.14 s for each case.

Applies to: show *where* in a changed function the fix is.

## 5. Rank changes by security features

Sources: Wang et al., *GraphSPD: Graph-Based Security Patch Detection with
Enriched Code Semantics*, IEEE S&P 2023.
<https://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10426263>. *StriderSPD: Structure-Guided Joint
Representation Learning for Binary Security Patch Detection*, 2026.
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05772>

Idea: a security fix has typical features: a new compare and a branch to an
error path, a new bounds check, or a change in the calls to memory, string or
lock functions. These features need no machine learning.

Applies to: the sort order of the report. A new guard is the strongest sign
of a fix (see "Lift more of what a guard can be" in `TODO.md`).

## 6. Weight an edit by how rare it is

Source: *Sift or Get Off the PoC: Applying Information Retrieval to
Vulnerability Research with SiftRank*, 2025.
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06155>. The weight is inverse document
frequency (IDF) from information retrieval.

Idea: an edit that occurs in 200 functions, as a moved global, is noise from
the build. An edit that occurs in one function is a signal.

Applies to: the sort order of the report, as a weight on each edit.

## Lower fit

- Ye, Zhou and Zhang, *Enhancing Semantic-Aware Binary Diffing with
  High-Confidence Dynamic Instruction Alignment*, NDSS 2026 (BARRACUDA).
  <https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/enhancing-semantic-aware-binary-diffing-with-high-confidence-dynamic-instruction-alignment/>
  Forced execution finds 24% more instruction anchors at 92.1% precision.
  It needs an emulator.
- LLM ranking of changed functions against the text of an advisory:

  SA2Pat <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-026-10942-z>,
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23970>. This fits a tool that reads
  `--format json`, not `hereticus` itself.
- MinHash and LSH for a fast search of similar functions:
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05492>. Use it only if the scoring of all pairs
  becomes too slow.
