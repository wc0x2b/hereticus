//! Pair the functions of one binary with the functions of another.
//!
//! Matching runs as an ordered cascade. Each stage pairs the functions it is
//! sure about, removes them from the pool, and leaves the rest to the next
//! stage. Stages run from most reliable to least, so a confident answer is
//! never overruled by a guess.
//!
//! The order matters for cost as well as accuracy. Early stages are hashes and
//! run in linear time. Only what survives them reaches the scoring stage,
//! which compares every remaining pair.
//!
//! Matching says *which* function became which. It does not say whether the
//! function changed: two matched functions can still differ, and
//! [`Match::changed`] reports that.
